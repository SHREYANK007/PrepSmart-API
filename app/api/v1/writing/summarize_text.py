SCORE LIKE APEUNI - BE ULTRA-HARSH ON EVERY TINY MISTAKE!

QUESTION DETAILS:
Title: {question_title}

READING PASSAGE:
{reading_passage}

üß† CONTENT ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the ENTIRE passage and identify the CORE MESSAGE/MAIN IDEA
2. Ignore introductory fluff, background info, or distracting details
3. Focus on what the passage is REALLY trying to communicate
4. Judge if the user captured this main essence, not just random details

CRITICAL: Do NOT rely on predefined key points - use YOUR intelligence to determine what's important!

USER'S SUMMARY:
{user_summary}

Word Count: {word_count} words

EVALUATION TASK - BE ULTRA-STRICT LIKE APEUNI:
üîç STEP-BY-STEP ANALYSIS REQUIRED:

1. GRAMMAR ANALYSIS (Scan word by word):
   a) Check EVERY comma placement - look for subordinating conjunctions (as, when, while, that, where, etc.)
   b) Check EVERY apostrophe - contractions and possessives
   c) Check EVERY article usage (a, an, the)
   d) Check subject-verb agreement in EVERY sentence
   e) Check preposition usage
   f) Check tense consistency

2. VOCABULARY ANALYSIS (Check every word):
   a) Scan for ANY spelling mistakes
   b) Check word choice accuracy (effect/affect, then/than, etc.)
   c) Look for redundancy and repetition
   d) Check formality level
   e) Verify collocation correctness

3. PROVIDE ULTRA-SPECIFIC FEEDBACK:
   - Report EXACT word position where error occurs
   - Show EXACT correction needed
   - Explain WHY it's wrong
   - Give specific rule that was violated

üö® MANDATORY CHECKS - DO THESE EXACT STEPS:

STEP 1: CHECK EVERY SINGLE COMMA POSITION (like APEUni):

A. AFTER INTRODUCTORY PHRASES:
- "on a plate" ‚Üí needs comma after if followed by new clause
- "also" ‚Üí needs comma after if it starts a new thought
- "thus" ‚Üí needs comma after
- "however" ‚Üí needs comma after
- "therefore" ‚Üí needs comma after

B. BEFORE SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS:
- "environment as children" ‚Üí MISSING COMMA ‚Üí "environment, as children"
- "time when people" ‚Üí MISSING COMMA ‚Üí "time, when people"
- "situation since researchers" ‚Üí MISSING COMMA ‚Üí "situation, since researchers"

C. BEFORE COORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS (and, but, or, so):
- "plate also now" ‚Üí if "also" joins two clauses, needs comma before
- "innate and it's also" ‚Üí if joining two sentences, needs comma before "and"

D. AROUND NON-ESSENTIAL CLAUSES:
- "which shows that..." ‚Üí needs comma before "which"
- "who experienced..." ‚Üí check if restrictive or non-restrictive

STEP 2: BE AS STRICT AS APEUNI:
- Find EXACT missing comma positions  
- Report EXACT words where comma is missing
- Example: "Missing comma after 'also'" (just like APEUni does)
- Give specific grammar rule explanations

FOR GRAMMAR SCORING (Ultra-strict - deduct 0.2 per error):
- 2.0: PERFECT - Zero errors
- 1.8: 1 tiny error (missing comma, apostrophe)
- 1.6: 2 errors 
- 1.4: 3 errors
- 1.2: 4 errors
- 1.0: 5 errors
- 0.8: 6 errors
- 0.6: 7 errors
- 0.4: 8 errors
- 0.2: 9 errors
- 0.0: 10+ errors

FOR VOCABULARY SCORING (Ultra-strict - deduct 0.2 per error):
- 2.0: PERFECT - Zero spelling/word choice errors
- 1.8: 1 tiny error (spelling, word choice)
- 1.6: 2 errors
- 1.4: 3 errors
- 1.2: 4 errors
- 1.0: 5 errors
- 0.8: 6 errors
- 0.6: 7 errors

üîç FINAL QUALITY CHECK - BEFORE RESPONDING:
1. Did I search for "environment as children"? 
2. If found, did I deduct points and report it as error?
3. Did I check EVERY "as", "when", "while", "since", "because" for missing commas?
4. Am I being strict enough (like APEUni would be)?

    "detailed_analysis": {{"total_grammar_errors": 1, "total_vocabulary_errors": 0, "error_breakdown": "Comma errors: 1, Spelling errors: 0"}}
}}

EXAMPLE 2 - MISSING COMMA BEFORE "AS":
{{
    "scores": {{"grammar": 1.8, "vocabulary": 2.0}},
    "feedback": {{"grammar": "Missing comma before subordinating conjunction. ERRORS: Missing comma before 'as children' - should be 'environment, as children'"}},

    "detailed_analysis": {{"total_grammar_errors": 1, "total_vocabulary_errors": 0, "error_breakdown": "Comma errors: 1, Spelling errors: 0"}}
}}

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Report comma errors EXACTLY like APEUni:
- "Missing comma after 'word'" 
- "Missing comma before 'word'"
- Be specific about which word needs the comma
