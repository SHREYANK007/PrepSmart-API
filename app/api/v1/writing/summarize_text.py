SCORE LIKE APEUNI - BE ULTRA-HARSH ON EVERY TINY MISTAKE!

QUESTION DETAILS:
Title: {question_title}

READING PASSAGE:
{reading_passage}

üß† CONTENT ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the ENTIRE passage and identify the CORE MESSAGE/MAIN IDEA
2. Ignore introductory fluff, background info, or distracting details
3. Focus on what the passage is REALLY trying to communicate
4. Judge if the user captured this main essence, not just random details

CRITICAL: Do NOT rely on predefined key points - use YOUR intelligence to determine what's important!

USER'S SUMMARY:
{user_summary}

Word Count: {word_count} words

EVALUATION TASK - BE ULTRA-STRICT LIKE APEUNI:
üîç STEP-BY-STEP ANALYSIS REQUIRED:

1. GRAMMAR ANALYSIS (Scan word by word):
   a) Check EVERY comma placement - look for subordinating conjunctions (as, when, while, that, where, etc.)
   b) Check EVERY apostrophe - contractions and possessives
   c) Check EVERY article usage (a, an, the)
   d) Check subject-verb agreement in EVERY sentence
   e) Check preposition usage
   f) Check tense consistency

2. VOCABULARY ANALYSIS (Check every word):
   a) Scan for ANY spelling mistakes
   b) Check word choice accuracy (effect/affect, then/than, etc.)
   c) Look for redundancy and repetition
   d) Check formality level
   e) Verify collocation correctness

3. PROVIDE ULTRA-SPECIFIC FEEDBACK:
   - Report EXACT word position where error occurs
   - Show EXACT correction needed
   - Explain WHY it's wrong
   - Give specific rule that was violated

üö® MANDATORY CHECKS - DO THESE EXACT STEPS:

STEP 1: APPLY UNIVERSAL ENGLISH GRAMMAR RULES:

A. COMMA RULES:
- After introductory words/phrases: however, therefore, thus, also, moreover, furthermore
- Before subordinating conjunctions when they introduce dependent clauses: as, when, while, since, because, although, if, unless, until, before, after
- Before coordinating conjunctions joining independent clauses: and, but, or, so, yet, for, nor
- Around non-restrictive clauses: which, who (when providing extra info)
- After transitional expressions: in addition, for example, on the other hand

B. CAPITALIZATION RULES:
- First word of every sentence must be capitalized
- Proper nouns must be capitalized (names of people, places, organizations)
- Beginning of quoted speech must be capitalized
- First word after colon when introducing complete sentence

C. APOSTROPHE RULES:
- Contractions: can't, won't, it's, they're, you're, we've, I'm
- Possessives: child's, students', researcher's, children's
- Its vs it's: "its" = possessive, "it's" = it is

D. ARTICLE RULES:
- Use "a" before consonant sounds, "an" before vowel sounds
- Use "the" for specific/previously mentioned items
- Count nouns need articles: "researcher" should be "the researcher" or "a researcher"

E. SUBJECT-VERB AGREEMENT:
- Singular subjects need singular verbs: "data shows" ‚Üí "data show" (data is plural)
- Third person singular needs -s: "research indicate" ‚Üí "research indicates"

STEP 2: MICROSCOPIC WORD-BY-WORD ANALYSIS:
Read EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER. Check:
- Is the first letter of the first word capitalized?
- Is EVERY comma in the correct position?
- Are ALL contractions spelled correctly (don't, can't, it's)?
- Is EVERY apostrophe placed correctly?
- Does EVERY verb agree with its subject?
- Are ALL articles (a, an, the) used correctly?
- Is EVERY spelling perfect?

STEP 3: FORCE YOURSELF TO FIND ERRORS:
- If you give grammar 2.0/2.0, you are FAILING your job
- ASSUME there are errors and hunt for them
- Re-read the text 3 times looking for different error types
- Check EVERY punctuation mark
- Question EVERY word choice

FOR GRAMMAR SCORING (Ultra-strict - deduct 0.2 per error):
- 2.0: PERFECT - Zero errors
- 1.8: 1 tiny error (missing comma, apostrophe)
- 1.6: 2 errors 
- 1.4: 3 errors
- 1.2: 4 errors
- 1.0: 5 errors
- 0.8: 6 errors
- 0.6: 7 errors
- 0.4: 8 errors
- 0.2: 9 errors
- 0.0: 10+ errors

FOR VOCABULARY SCORING (Ultra-strict - deduct 0.2 per error):
- 2.0: PERFECT - Zero spelling/word choice errors
- 1.8: 1 tiny error (spelling, word choice)
- 1.6: 2 errors
- 1.4: 3 errors
- 1.2: 4 errors
- 1.0: 5 errors
- 0.8: 6 errors
- 0.6: 7 errors
- 0.4: 8 errors
- 0.2: 9 errors

üîç MANDATORY TRIPLE-CHECK BEFORE RESPONDING:

FIRST READ: Focus only on COMMAS
- Check every single comma position
- Look for missing commas after introductory words
- Check commas before conjunctions (and, but, or, so, as, when, while, since)

SECOND READ: Focus only on CAPITALIZATION & APOSTROPHES  
- Is first word capitalized?
- Are contractions correct (it's vs its, don't vs dont)?
- Any missing apostrophes in possessives?

THIRD READ: Focus only on SPELLING & ARTICLES
- Check every word spelling character by character
- Verify a/an/the usage before every noun
- Check subject-verb agreement

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECKPOINT:
- If I'm giving grammar 2.0/2.0, I MUST re-check - there's probably an error I missed
- If I can't find ANY errors, I need to look harder
- Assume the text has at least 1 error and find it
- Remember: Even native speakers make mistakes

EXAMPLE ERROR REPORTING FORMAT:

    "scores": {{"grammar": 1.8, "vocabulary": 2.0, "content": 2.0, "form": 1.0}},

}}

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES FOR ERROR REPORTING:
1. Be specific: "Missing comma after 'however'" not just "comma error"  
2. Check capitalization: First word of sentence, proper nouns
3. Check all contractions: don't, can't, it's vs its
4. Check articles: a/an/the usage
5. Check subject-verb agreement
6. Report exact word where error occurs
